# ABOUT THIS APP

Supporting Add-on for Demisto. This application allows a user to create incident into Demisto from Splunk using custom alert action.


# REQUIREMENTS

* Splunk version 6.3 >=
* This application should be installed on Search Head.

# Recommended System configuration
* Standard Splunk configuration of Search Head.

# Installation in Splunk Cloud
* Same as on-premise setup.

# Installation of App

* This app can be installed through UI using "Manage Apps" or from the command line using the following command:
$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk install app $PATH_TO_SPL/TA-Demisto.spl/

# HTTPS Certificate Validation

The add-on uses secure communication with Demisto.

On few occasions it would be necessary to manually set a certificate for proper verification.

There are several options for adding a self-signed certificate or a certificate from internal certificate signers AFTER
installing the app:

1) Put the PEM formatted certificate bundle inside Splunk server under:
$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-Demisto/local/cert_bundle.pem

2) Add the certificate to the app installation tgz:
    2.1) Extract TA-Demisto tgz
    2.2) Create "local" directory under TA-Demisto
    2.3) Place the certificate in that folder
    In the end the certificate should be in the following path:
    your-local-path/TA-Demisto/local/cert_bundle.pem

Splunk Cloud users should perform option 2 and send the app installer to Splunk support for installation.

Another option which applies ONLY for on-prem installations and is cannot be used for Splunk Cloud:

Disabling the certificate validation entirely by POSTing to the Splunk REST API
https://splunk-server:8089/servicesNS/nobody/TA-Demisto/configs/conf-demistosetup/demistoenv
with the following as the request body:
verify_ssl=false

For example, via CURL:
curl -ku 'username:password' https://localhost:8089/servicesNS/nobody/TA-Demisto/configs/conf-demistosetup/demistoenv/ -d VALIDATE_SSL=false

To re-enable certificate validation post to the same endpoint but change "verify_ssl" to true.

For example, via CURL:
curl -ku 'username:password' https://localhost:8089/servicesNS/nobody/TA-Demisto/configs/conf-demistosetup/demistoenv/ -d VALIDATE_SSL=true

We recommend to use certificates, and only disabling certificate verification in development
or test environments only. Never disable certificate verification for a production system.

* User can directly extract the app's SPL file into $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/ folder in order to install the app.
