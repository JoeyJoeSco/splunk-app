The CLA document is also available for review as a [PDF](https://github.com/demisto/content/blob/master/docs/cla.pdf).

If the `license/cla` status check remains on *Pending*, even though all contributors have accepted the CLA, you can recheck the CLA status by visiting the following link (replace **[PRID]** with the ID of your PR): https://cla-assistant.io/check/demisto/splunk-app?pullRequest=[PRID] .
